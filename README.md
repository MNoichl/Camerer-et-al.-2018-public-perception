# Replication and public perception

Cramer et al. (2018) took twenty-one studies from *Nature* and *Science* and tried to replicate them. Thirteen replications were successful, meaning that a significant effect in the same direction as in the original study could be found. I looked at the *Altmetrics* of these studies, to see how they fared in the public perception. Altmetrics measure the distribution of a scientific work to the general public by looking at how often it is posted on facebook, tweeted, picked up by media-outlets, etc. 
Here I provide code, data, and bit of commentary for this project.
